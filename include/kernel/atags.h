// Atags is a list of information about certain aspects of the hardware. This list is created by the bootloader before our kernel is loaded. 
// The bootloader places it at address 0x100, passes that address to the kernel through register r2
// The Atags can tell us how large the memory is, where the bootloader put a ramdisk, what is the serial number of the board, and the command line passed to the kernel via cmdline.txt
// An Atag consists of a size (in 4 byte words), a tag identifier, and tag specific information. The list of Atags always starts with the CORE tag, with identifier 0x54410001, and ends with a NONE tag, with identifier 0.
// The tags are concatenated together, so the next tag in the list can be found by adding the number of bytes specified by the size to the current Atagâ€™s pointer.
